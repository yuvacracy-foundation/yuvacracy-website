Week 3: decoding the monsoon session of the Rajya Sabha Week 4 (the favourite): drafting a policy proposal on the Right to Health Working with YuvaCracy Centre for Policy Research (YCPR) wasn't just an internship, it was crash course on how governance, policy and research actually breathe outside textbooks. The team was sharp and supportive, the cohort was brilliant, and the work had the rare balance of meaningful impact + actual fun. I walked away with skills, perspectives, and a clarity I wouldn't have stumbled upon otherwise. For anyone curious about how policy isn't just made in air-conditioned rooms but in the sweat of research and collective dialogue - THIS INTERNSHIP IS WORTH IT! Grateful to the YuvaCracy Centre for Policy Research (YCPR) team for making these four weeks unforgettable. 🌱",

    desc: "Thrilled to share highlights from my internship journey with Yuvacracy! Over the past month, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at the YuvaCracy Centre for Policy Research (YCPR) — a platform dedicated to empowering young minds to actively engage in policy research and analysis. During my time here, I worked on analysing the Economic Survey and a Legislative Bill, which significantly sharpened my skills in research, analytical thinking, teamwork, and leadership. One of the standout moments was an eye-opening session on How to Track the Work of the MP and MLA of Your Area— where we learned to navigate the Sansad website to understand our elected representatives better. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience that you rarely come across! In addition, I attended several insightful seminars organized by the Yuvacracy team, which expanded my understanding of policy and governance. I’m incredibly thankful for the supportive team, mentorship, and collaborative environment that made each day a rich learning experience. A heartfelt thank you to Shivashish Narayan, Srishtistuti R, and the entire YuvaCracy Foundation team for making this internship so meaningful. Special gratitude to Ashish Mishra , the visionary founder of YuvaCracy Foundation, for creating such a powerful platform that uplifts and enables young individuals like me. Feeling grateful and privileged to have contributed in my own small way — and excited to carry these learnings forward in my journey ahead!",
